About AGE:
AGE is short for ASCII Game Engine.
How simple and crude could a game rendering be? AGE is born because of
the thinking of this problem partly, as well it is an exploration on logic
layer architecture of a game engine for the project founder. The author
tried his best to make interface rich and flexible although the tutorial
program looks pretty simple. The entire project is written in pure C to
ensure the conciseness and portability. It's a nice case for beginners
to start with game development; some useful components may be extracted
separately for those who are experienced; indie-game developers can use
it directly to create more funny games; students who are only familiar
with C and console application development can aware of cool programs
could be based on humble technique.

About the Author:
I've been interested in video games since I was a little boy, and I began
to study how to develop games after I played those fantastic games when
I was in college. I took game coder as my career after my graduation from
college because it's my favorite. I also make some indie-games and reuseable
open source components during my spare time. My blog is
http://blog.sina.com.cn/auroratony, my Chinese articles maybe confuse you
if you have no idea about Chinese, but I'll write indie-game related
articles in English. Feel free to contact me.
I'll be very glad if you could send me your games created with AGE.
